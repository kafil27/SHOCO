# SHOCO

Project Description
SHOCO is a state-of-the-art e-commerce website that caters to shoe enthusiasts who appreciate quality and brand value. We have curated a selection of only the highest quality shoes from premium brands, ensuring that our customers have access to the best products on the market. This project was undertaken as a part of our university curriculum and was successfully completed by our team of dedicated students.
Website Details
The website is designed with user experience at its core. Each section of the website serves a specific purpose:
1.	Homepage/Landing Page: This is the first point of contact for users. It is designed to be visually appealing and provides a snapshot of what the website offers.
2.	Product Page: This page showcases all the products available on the website. Each product is displayed with an image, price, and brief description.
3.	Product Details Page: When a user clicks on a product, they are taken to this page. It provides detailed information about the product, including its features, brand, price, and customer reviews.
4.	User Section: This section is dedicated to users. It allows them to sign in and sign up, view their profile, track their orders, and manage their account settings.
5.	Cart Page & Order Page: The cart page displays all the items that a user has added to their cart. From here, users can proceed to the order page to place their order.
6.	Admin Page: This page is accessible only to site administrators. It provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing the website, including adding or removing products, managing orders, and viewing site analytics.
7.	Merchant Page: This page is for merchants who sell their products on our platform. It provides them with tools to manage their products, track their sales, and view their earnings.
8.	Contact Us & About Page: These pages provide information about the team behind the website and how users can get in touch with us for any queries or support.
9.	Become a Merchant Page: This page provides information for prospective merchants. It explains how they can join our platform and start selling their products.
Site Functionalities
The website is dynamic and interactive, providing a smooth and seamless user experience. It includes a secure payment gateway (Razor Pay), allowing users to make transactions with confidence. The website also features smooth animations for an enhanced user experience, and a dedicated admin page for website management.

Tech Stack
The website was built using a combination of modern tools and frameworks:

•	Backend: JavaScript
•	Database: Google’s Cloud Firebase Realtime Database
•	Authentication: Firebase Auth
•	Libraries: Several other libraries were used to enhance functionality and user experience.
Challenge Accepted!
This project serves as a testament to the power of teamwork and effective use of modern tools like Cloud Firestore and GSAP. We successfully tackled the challenge of building a robust and visually appealing e-commerce website without relying on React or similar frameworks. Through this process, we gained valuable experience in:
•	Smartwork: Employing efficient practices to achieve project goals.
•	Teamwork: Collaborative problem-solving and communication.
•	Collaboration: Working effectively together to deliver a unified product.
•	Modern Tools & Techniques: Leveraging cutting-edge technologies for optimal results.
We invite you to explore the Shoco codebase and learn how we achieved a dynamic and performant website using vanilla JavaScript and Cloud Firestore.
This project was a great learning experience for us. We not only met the challenge posed by our opponents but also gained valuable hands-on experience with teamwork, collaboration, and the use of modern tools, frameworks, and techniques. We hope you enjoy using SHOCO as much as we enjoyed building it!
